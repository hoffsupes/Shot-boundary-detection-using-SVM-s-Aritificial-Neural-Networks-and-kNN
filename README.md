# Shot Boundary Detection Using Supervised Learning Techniques
A shot is a continious sequence of frames filmed in one go. The regions of discrepency between two shots is called the shot boundary. 

Various discriminatory features like the frame variance, mean, L2-norm etc are taken and then various classifiers are used to compare their performances.

Best performance is achieved by The Linear SVM with a classification accuracy of 92.99%.
